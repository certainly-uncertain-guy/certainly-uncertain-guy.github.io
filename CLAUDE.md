# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Start local dev server (http://localhost:4000)
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Build the site into _site/
bundle exec jekyll build
```

The `_site/` directory is generated output — never edit files there directly.

## Git

**Never `git commit` or `git add`/stage any changes without first asking the user for explicit permission**, even if a prior message in the session approved a commit — each commit needs its own ask. This overrides the default commit workflow.

## Architecture

This is a Jekyll static site (personal portfolio + blog) for Ashutosh Shukla, deployed to GitHub Pages at `ashutoshshuklaUT.github.io`.

**Layout hierarchy:**
- `_layouts/default.html` — master shell: header, nav, footer, and the dark-mode toggle (JS reads/writes `localStorage` and flips `data-theme` on `<html>`). All other layouts extend this.
- `_layouts/post.html` — wraps individual blog posts inside `default`.
- `_layouts/page.html` — wraps static pages inside `default`.

**Styling (`assets/css/main.scss`):**  
Imports Minima as a base, then overrides everything with CSS custom properties. All colors are defined as `--variable` tokens in two blocks: `:root, [data-theme="light"]` and `[data-theme="dark"]`. To change the color scheme, edit those token blocks — don't hardcode colors elsewhere.

**Content files:**
- `index.markdown` — homepage bio, uses the `default` layout directly (not `page`).
- `blog/index.html` — static hub page linking to the three sections below. No longer a post feed.
- `learning/index.html`, `mentoring/index.html`, `misc/index.html` — the three blog sections (see "Blog taxonomy" below).
- `_data/misc_pages.yml` — list of standalone "living pages" (e.g. a future running-stats page) shown as cards on `/misc/`; empty until one is added.
- `_posts/` — blog posts; filename must follow Jekyll convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`, front matter needs `layout: post` (set by default in `_config.yml`). Every post's `:title` permalink segment comes from the **filename**, not the front-matter `title:`.

**Plugins (configured in `_config.yml` and `Gemfile`):**  
`jekyll-feed`, `jekyll-seo-tag`, `jekyll-sitemap`. The `{% seo %}` tag in `default.html` handles meta tags automatically from `_config.yml` fields. (`jekyll-paginate` is listed in the `Gemfile` but was never added to `_config.yml`'s `plugins:` list, and nothing in the site uses it.)

**Blog taxonomy:** Every post must set `categories` to exactly one of `learning`, `mentoring`, or `misc` — this determines both which section page it appears on and its permalink prefix (`permalink: /:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title/` in `_config.yml`). `tags` are freeform and optional:
- **Learning** (`/learning/`) — reverse-chronological, with a client-side tag filter (`assets/js/tag-filter.js`) driven by whatever tags appear on Learning posts.
- **Mentoring** (`/mentoring/`) — not chronological; grouped by tag as a scannable reference list. Untagged Mentoring posts fall into a "General" group so nothing is dropped.
- **Misc** (`/misc/`) — reverse-chronological dated posts, plus an optional card area for standalone "living pages" listed in `_data/misc_pages.yml` (empty by default).

No pagination is used on any of these pages.
